## Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/klncgty/octro.git
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Dependencies

To install the required Python packages for the API, use the requirements.txt file located in the project‚Äôs root directory:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the API

The API code is located in the api folder. Navigate to the api folder in your terminal and start the FastAPI application:
```bash
cd ../api
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Frontend

The frontend code is located in the src folder. Navigate to the src folder in your terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
cd src
npm install
npm run dev
```

After running the command, you will see an output similar to this in your terminal:
```
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:port/
```

click on terminal to visualize app [http://localhost:port/](http://localhost:port/) 


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- ** PDF uploading:**  
  Uploaded PDF files will be saved in the uploads folder in your local directory.
- ** Outputs:**  
Outputs generated from processed PDF files are saved in the outputs folder. Ensure this folder exists and has write permissions.
- ** CORS error:**  
If you encounter an error in the browser like this:
  ```
  Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/upload' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy
  ```

  You can solve erorr  adding this `allow_origins=["*"]`  to `api/main.py`  

  ```python
  from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["*"],  # T√ºm domainlere izin verir
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  ```

## üìå Add.

- **Frontend and API Communication:**  
The frontend interacts with the API to upload and process PDF files. Ensure both are running simultaneously.
- **Development:**  
 ....


- **Models**  
   gmft: https://github.com/conjuncts/gmft and
  pandasai base model: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00061
